                <h1>Laptop, Laptop Sleeve, Bluetooth Mouse</h1>
                <p>
                    This is my laptop and computer accessories. My laptop is a Razer Blade 14 which I purchased in 2021 as 
                    I was entering university. As a mechanical engineering student, I need its powerful specs and Windows 
                    operating system to run 3D modeling software. If I need to use it for more than 2 hours, I bring my charger.
                    Although it is an expensive piece of equipment, I was lucky that my university provided its
                    students a one-time technology grant, which I used to cover the costs. I have been using it well
                    since my freshman year! The laptop sleeve is a hand-me-down from my father and I use it for my
                    laptop as well as my iPad. The mouse is a Kakao product with their trademark character, and my
                    favorite, Ryan. I used to have another Ryan mouse that was completely orange, but it stopped working
                    after a few years of good use. I like this mouse because it is Bluetooth and silent-click.

                <h1>Jacket</h1>
                <p>
                    I wore this jacket today (March 13th, 2023) because it is a light jacket that I think is 
                    fashionable (I am not fashionable). I like to wear it when it is cool outside, when it is
                    a little too cold to wear a single layer, but too hot to wear my other, thicker jackets.
                    I also like it because it has nice pockets that I can put my smaller, but frequently used things.
                    I believe I purchased this in the winter of 2021 at the Hyundai Premium Outlet in Songdo, 
                    Incheon, South Korea.

                <img id="down" style="display: none;" src="static/Down Vest.png" onclick="down()">

            <div id="down-text" class="item" style="display: none;">
                <h1>Down Vest</h1>
                <p>
                    This is an "ultra-light" down vest that I purchased from Uniqlo last year (2022) in the Fall/Winter.
                    Like its name suggests, it is very light and although I don't really like how it looks, it is warm.
                    I bring it with me when I stay out until the late evening when it gets much colder. I try to wear it
                    underneath a jacket to hide it. Still, it is much better than carrying around a thick, heavy jacket,
                    especially because it folds into a small cylinder. I recently brought it with me to the SNU school
                    festival--it was extremely hot in the afternoon, but quickly became cold by the time the festival ended.
                    Sometimes I wish it had sleeves.

            <div id="masks-text" class="item" style="display: none;">
                <h1>Masks</h1>
                <p>
                    These "emergency" masks have been in my backpack for a while.. a couple years in fact! Ever since the
                    pandemic, I have been carrying around masks in my backpack in case I needed to replace the one I was wearing
                    at the time. I don't really like this shape of mask, but of course if I need to change my mask I go with what
                    I have.
